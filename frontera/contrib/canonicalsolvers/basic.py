    Implements a simple CanonicalSolver taking always first URL from redirect chain, if there were redirects.
    It allows easily to avoid leaking of requests in CF (e.g. when request issued by
    :attr:`get_next_requests() <frontera.core.manager.FrontierManager.get_next_requests>` never matched in
    :attr:`page_crawled() <frontera.core.manager.FrontierManager.page_crawled>`) at the price of duplicating
    records in CF for pages having more than one URL or complex redirects chains.
